All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres loosely to Semantic Versioning.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-17
### Fixed - Critical Security & CI/CD Resolution
- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY**: Removed exposed API keys from .env file
  - Removed X.AI API key: `FbpieK4I53TKtI5ncBWiuglLHApmhMhVqkWjYklW3x1WYpWQDn668Um284nrmLAT6CGUmyoISkjUPwOy`
  - Removed ElevenLabs API key: `sk_a9af05974c66e98054c3912a289e61fc92252ff3f3dcf7fc`
  - **ACTION REQUIRED**: These keys must be revoked immediately from respective consoles
- **CI/CD Pipeline Fixes**: Resolved conflicts between PR 22 and PR 23
  - Fixed truncated `ci-cd.yml` workflow that was missing deployment steps
  - Updated `deploy.yml` to deprecated status with informational notice
  - Improved Vercel deployment workflow to handle PR vs production deployments
- **Environment Security**: Hardened environment configuration
  - Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent future API key leaks
  - Updated environment service to read from `VITE_USE_MOCKS` environment variable
  - Set `VITE_USE_MOCKS=true` as secure default for development
  - Standardized environment variable naming (`VITE_XAI_API_KEY`)

### Added - Documentation & Deployment Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Documentation Suite**:
  - `VERCEL_GUIDE.md`: Complete Vercel CLI usage guide with token management
  - `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`: Full security assessment and remediation status
  - `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`: Pre/post deployment verification checklist
  - `CI_CD_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`: Summary of workflow improvements and cleanup
- **Multi-Platform Deployment Support**:
  - GitHub Pages: Primary deployment platform (automatic on main branch)
  - Vercel: Secondary deployment with PR previews and production builds
  - Netlify: Removed unused integration to clean up CI/CD pipeline

### Enhanced - Build System & Developer Experience
- **Build Verification**: All build targets tested and working
  - âœ… Default build: `npm run build`
  - âœ… Vercel build: `npm run build:vercel`
  - âœ… GitHub Pages build: `npm run build:github-pages`
  - âœ… Test suite: `npm test` (3 tests passing)
- **Documentation Updates**: Merged and updated README deployment section
  - Removed references to unused Netlify deployment
  - Added comprehensive Vercel CLI management instructions
  - Clarified active deployment platforms and workflows

### Security
- **High Priority**: API key exposure resolved but requires immediate key revocation
- **Environment Protection**: `.gitignore` updated to prevent future credential leaks
- **Workflow Security**: GitHub Actions pinned to specific commit SHAs
- **Default Security**: Mock services enabled by default (`VITE_USE_MOCKS=true`)

### Notes
This release resolves the critical conflicts between PR 22 (security fixes) and PR 23 (CI/CD cleanup) by merging the best aspects of both. The application is now deployment-ready with proper security hardening, but **immediate action is required** to revoke the exposed API keys before production deployment.
