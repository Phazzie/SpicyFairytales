- [ ] Input validation implemented for all services
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Test Checklist

### Build Verification
- [ ] `npm run build` passes without errors
- [ ] `npm run validate` passes with correct API keys
- [ ] Bundle size within acceptable limits
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Mock services tested and working
- [ ] Real API integration tested (with test keys)
- [ ] End-to-end user workflow verified

## üöÄ Deployment Environment Checklist

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] `VITE_XAI_API_KEY` configured
- [ ] `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` configured  
- [ ] `VITE_USE_MOCKS=false` for production
- [ ] `VITE_GROK_MODEL` set to appropriate model

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Server/hosting platform configured
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] SSL certificate installed
- [ ] Domain/subdomain configured

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] API usage monitoring enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured

## üìã Post-Deployment Verification

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Story generation working with real APIs
- [ ] Speaker parsing functioning correctly
- [ ] Voice synthesis producing audio
- [ ] Audio playback working in browser
- [ ] Export functionality operational

### Performance

- [ ] API rate limits respected

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
1. **Immediate**: Switch to mock services (`VITE_USE_MOCKS=true`)
2. **Fallback**: Revert to previous working deployment
3. **Investigation**: Check logs for errors
4. **Communication**: Notify users of temporary service interruption

### Rollback Triggers
- API key issues or rate limits exceeded
- Build/deployment failures
- Critical security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable limits
